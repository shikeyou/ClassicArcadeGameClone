# Classic Arcade Game Clone

---

## Introduction

This is Project 3 for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

Main objectives of this project:

* Given some game assets and a game loop engine, create the classic arcade game Frogger
* Use object-oriented features of JavaScript to write well-designed classes

## Online Live View

The website is available online for viewing at [http://shikeyou.github.io/ClassicArcadeGameClone/](http://shikeyou.github.io/ClassicArcadeGameClone/)

## Files

These are the files that I have edited:

* **js/app.js:** The main JavaScript file with JavaScript classes for Enemy, Player etc. The codes are mainly written from scratch.

* **js/engine.js:** The game loop engine provided. I have edited a large chunk of the codes to provide additional features such as score system.

These are the files/folders that are provided for this project by Udacity:

* **index.html:** Simple HTML5 file for loading the JavaScript files

* **js/resources.js:** helper object for loading and caching images

* **css/style.css:** Some basic CSS styles

* **images:** Main images folder

## Running The Project

1. Clone the repository

2. Open *index.html* in a web browser (Google Chrome is recommended)

## How To Play

* Press the arrow keys to move the character from the grass to the water, without hitting any of the ladybugs.

* Earn 5 points for reaching the water, after which the character will be transported back to the grass again for you to continue the game.

* Score resets to 0 if you hit any ladybug. An on-going high score is recorded and displayed. 

* Collect gems and stars along the way to get more points:
	* Blue gem: +1
	* Green gem: +3
	* Star: +10
